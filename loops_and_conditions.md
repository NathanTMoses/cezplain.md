# Loops
## `for` loops
A for loop is the most common kind of loop.
The basic layout of a for loop is 
```
for(int _ = 0; _ < _; _++)
{
  
}
```
The name of the variable can be your decision but I'll call it `x`
Now the whole purpose of a loop is to run a piece of code multiple times, let's say I want it to run 3 times.
Now we have 
```
for(int x = 0; x < 3; x++)
{

}
```
So what this means is that a I have variable x that is 0.

until x is equal to 3, then add 1 to x and at the same time run the code one time
So we'll run it when x is 0,1 and 2 and that's 3 total times.
## `while` loops
A while loop is where you don't want to run code a certain number of times, but run it until a certain condition is true.

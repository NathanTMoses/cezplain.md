#`printf`
The basic print function.
The layout is `printf("__\n");`
In the underline you put what you want to write.
The `/n` is for moving the start of the next printf or the `~/workspace/` to the next line.


Let's say I want to print "n is " and then the variable n and n is an int, I would do `printf("n is %i", n)` but I would replace the `%i`
with a `%s` if n is a string.

This file is about variables.
#### For this script we'll assume that we want to store a int with a value of `100`
# What's a variable?
A variable is like a box.
A box is for storing stuff to use later and a variable is the same thing. A variable is putting a char, int, string or something else into a 
"box" for use in a program.
# How do you make a variable?
## The basics
So let's get down to the core! The following is the foundation of a variable : ` _ _ = ___;`

Now that's really vague and that's because variable are really "variable" and there are many different kinds of variables (See what I did there?)
## The data type
Now the first blank is what's called a data type and if you don't know what that is look at the following for data type explained or else skip the next part.
### A data type is the format of the data, there are many of these including string, int, char, struct and others.
So anyway now you know what a data type is and there are many but the ones that really matter are `string` and `int`.

As you can guess `string` is for a word of any length and `int` is for an **integer** of any length, you'll learn floats and long longs later.
Now we want to store a integer so our data type is `int`.

Now we've got `int _ = ___;`
## The name
Now this is the most fun part!
Since the name of the variable doesn't affect the variable itself you can call it things like "Invincible_Ironman" or "Pretty_Cinderella"
but for this example we'll call it name

The result is `int name = ___;`
### The `=` is for assigning a value to a variable with a specified variable type.
## The value
This is the important part of the variable.
Now the value could be a function or another variable or a variable inside a function!
but here we're just doing 100 so we enter `100`!
#### Note : for a string you'll have to put `"` on both sides of the string.
Now we have `int name = 100;`
#### The `;` is just to signify the end of the file
